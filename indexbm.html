                Fashion has always been our first love. We were always obsessed with clothes,
                magazines, runway collections and shopping growing up. We would always take 
                one hour to get our outfits ready for going to class when we were at school. 
                To us, choosing our outfits was more fun than where ever it was that we had 
                to be. It has always been a part of us and has always given us the ability 
                to convey a message without speaking and avidly express ourselves.
